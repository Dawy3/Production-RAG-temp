## How to run Chattie

**Step 1: Install Docker**

- Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Open Docker Desktop and make sure it's running (you'll see a green icon in your taskbar)

**Step 2: Set up your settings**

- In the project folder, find the file called `.env.example`
- Make a copy of it and rename the copy to `.env`
- Open `.env` with any text editor (Notepad works fine)
- Fill in your API keys:
  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
  QDRANT_URL=your-qdrant-url-here
  QDRANT_API_KEY=your-qdrant-key-here
  ```
- Save and close the file

**Step 3: Start Chattie**

- Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal)
- Navigate to the project folder:
  ```
  cd path\to\the\project\folder
  ```
- Run this command:
  ```
  docker compose up
  ```
- Wait until you see messages saying the services are ready (this may take a few minutes the first time)

**Step 4: Open Chattie**

- Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:3000**
- Click the chat bubble in the bottom-right corner
- You're ready to go!

**To stop Chattie:**

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| "Cannot connect" or blank page | Make sure Docker Desktop is running and you ran `docker compose up` |
| Docker says "port already in use" | Another app is using port 3000 or 8000. Close it and try again |
| "OPENAI_API_KEY not set" error | Make sure you created the `.env` file and added your key |
| Upload fails | Check that your file is one of the supported types and under 50 MB |
